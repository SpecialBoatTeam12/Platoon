# Platoon

Platoon is a terminal-based choose your own adventure story written using python. This project was inspured by a friends game so I decided to learn python myself and he gave me the idea to make something like platon. I plan on releasing an executable file when the first main story line is finished. Until then I will release indiviual python files that are able to be fun in your terminal. 

**THE LATEST VERSION OF PYTHON IS REQUIRED**
